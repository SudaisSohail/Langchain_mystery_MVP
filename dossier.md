## 3. Internal Communications & Ethics Review

### Email Excerpts (Chronological)

| Date | From | To | Subject | Content Snippet |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-11-19 | S. Jenkins | D. Crowe | Budget Freeze Imminent | "Dr. Crowe, if we don't finalize the budget for the next quarter now, finance is threatening a freeze. This project is spiraling out of control." |
| 2025-11-20 | Dr. A. Crowe | Dr. H. Ward | Re: Meeting Tuesday | "Helena, I’m free at 10 AM. Let's touch base on the latest cipher results before the review board meeting. I need to make sure the data is clean before it goes public." |
| **2025-11-23** | **Dr. H. Ward** | **O. Grant** | **Re: Meeting Tonight** | **"Oliver, please confirm you have secured the necessary funds. The transfer is ready once the work is done. You know how important it is that the server data—especially the older project files—is permanently erased. We cannot risk exposure. I can’t go to jail. I need those logs gone by tomorrow."** |
| 2025-11-24 | M. Harris | All Staff | High Security Alert | "All staff must change their access credentials immediately. There's been a known vulnerability in the VPN layer." |

**CRITICAL CLUE:** The email from **H. Ward** to **O. Grant** confirms the promise of a **transfer/bribe** to secure the **deletion of logs**, directly linking the two suspects.

### Ethics Review Finding (Extract)

**Project:** Behavioral Cryptography Sub-Study 4B
**Researcher:** Dr. Helena Ward
**Ethics Committee Decision (2025-11-15):** **UNAPPROVED**.
**Comments:** Dr. Ward's proposed methodology involves the use of **unapproved psychological stimuli and deceptive practices** on non-conforming participants. This represents a gross **ethics violation** and must cease immediately. There are concerns this experiment has already been conducted without authorization, which would constitute **unapproved behavioral experiments** outside the scope of Obsidian's mandate. The use of certain non-lethal, high-stress agents was specifically forbidden.

**CRITICAL CLUE:** This finding ties **Dr. Helena Ward** directly to **ethics violations** and running **unapproved/illegal experiments**.

## 4. Miscellaneous Notes and Academic Material

### Desk Notes (Mixed Sources - 2025-11-25)

* **Dr. Crowe's Notepad:** The person with access to finances and logs is the true threat. (Highlighted section)
* **O. Grant's Scratchpad:** Need to fix the data sync issue on Server 3. Too much pressure. Who can I trust?
* **H. Ward's Memo:** New focus group results needed by end of day. If the results are bad, the project is done.

### Matthew Crowe's Academic Notes (Extract) - Red Herring

**Source:** Criminology Master's Thesis Proposal – Draft Chapter 2 (M. Crowe)
**Topic:** Forensic Analysis of Non-Traditional Homicide Methods.
**Excerpt: Chapter 2.3 – Subtle Agents**

...The complexity of diagnosing death by chemical agents, specifically those affecting the cardiovascular system, highlights a significant investigative gap. For instance, certain naturally occurring toxins, when administered in controlled micro-doses, can mimic the acute symptoms of a myocardial infarction (heart attack) but leave minimal traces in post-mortem toxicology reports. This academic exploration is purely for the purpose of analyzing cold case investigative failures. The focus of this chapter is methodology and theory, not practical application in the field. This research is approved by the university department.

**CRITICAL CLUE (RED HERRING):** This section on **"poison research"** is explicitly detailed as **academic coursework** (criminology thesis) and is **irrelevant to the case's malicious intent**
